Tonight, let's start the masquerade. "I'm coming
over"
But nobody knows my little secret
모든 걸 보여주기엔 좀 이르잖니
아껴 둬 Never talk, never tell
When you feel it, come and get it
감당해 봐 Truth or Dare, It's alright
Yeah I could be there for you, yeah I can be
there
솔직한 나를 원했거든
좀 더 기다려 I'll party all night
Yeah get this party started, let's get it
started
Yeah nobody knows (Know)
Yeah nobody knows 보이는 대로 믿는 Good time
(Such a good time)
Yeah such a good time together (Such a good
time)
Yeah nobody knows (Know)
Yeah nobody knows 아무도 본 적 없는 Dancing in
shadow (Guess what)
나만의 Good time forever (That's right)
미소 뒤에 숨긴 나의 Villain 같은 Vibe
굳이 쓸데없는 얘긴 잘 안 하는 Type
For real? (For real! For real!)
And later in the night, 저 달빛 아래 홀로 서
깊은 어둠조차 두렵지 않아 Babe
When you feel it, come and get it
이끌리지 너도 모르게 Right
Yeah I could be there for you, yeah I can be
there
어떤 날 상상했는지는
딱히 내게 중요하지 않아
Yeah get this party started, let's get it
started
Yeah nobody knows (Know)
Yeah nobody knows 보이는 대로 믿는 Good time
(Such a good time)
Yeah such a good time together (Such a good
time)
Yeah nobody knows (Know)
Yeah nobody knows 아무도 본 적 없는 Dancing in
shadow (Guess what)
나만의 Good time forever (That's right)
Yeah what's good!
Take your time, take your time time
Take your time time, take your time time time
Let's flip that switch!
I'm a wild, I'm a wild wild
I'm a wild wild, I'm a wild wild wild
Yeah what's good!
Take your time, take your time time
Take your time time, take your time time time
Let's flip that switch!
Make it wild, make it wild wild
Make it wild wild, make it wild wild wild
When you feel it, come and get it
너도 나와 함께 Party all night
Yeah get this party started, let's get it
started
Yeah nobody knows (Know)
Yeah nobody knows 보이는 대로 믿어 Good boy
(Such a good time)
Yeah such a good time together (Such a good
time)

Yeah nobody knows 더 깊이 자유로운 Dancing in
shadow (Guess what)
나만의 Good time forever (That's right)
Good time forever
